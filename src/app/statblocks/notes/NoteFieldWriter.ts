/**
 * The one writer of statblock note values (§8.1 invariant 6, §8.4, §8.5).
 *
 * Every write picks its backend per note when it is flushed, whatever started it:
 * - **editor**: a loaded `MarkdownView` in an editing mode holds the note, in any window. The
 *   patches apply to its buffer and only the changed range goes in as one `editor.transaction`,
 *   at once: one undo step in the note, unsaved typing kept, other leaves following, Obsidian
 *   saving. Reading view and deferred leaves never count (spike S2).
 * - **vault**: otherwise `vault.process`, atomic against Obsidian's other writes. Disk writes of a
 *   note coalesce for `COALESCE_MS`; a flush writes them at once.
 * A note whose properties Atlas cannot read is never written: its patches come back as conflicts
 * with the problem. A patch whose base the note no longer holds is a conflict; the rest still apply.
 *
 * One per app, released when the plugin unloads (which starts the last flush).
